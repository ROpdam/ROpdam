### Hi :wave:
### Robin Opdam - ROpdam

A Data Scientist who is excited about the field and just started exploring its massive community. I am currently:
- 🧑‍🎓 Learning [Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html) as the [Polars library](https://github.com/pola-rs/polars) sparked my curiosity.
- 🧑‍🎓 Learning Japanese basics through Busuu, definitely recommend this app with its built-in community!
- 📖 Reading through The Culture Map from Erin Meyer, Peter Flach's Machine Learning book and But How Do It Know by J. Clark Scott.

I infrequently write about [my own experiences](https://medium.com/@ropdam) to share (and remember).

Thanks for visiting my profile and don't hesitate to connect with me!
